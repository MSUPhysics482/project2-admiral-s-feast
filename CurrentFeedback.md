Parker and Kristen, it looks like your potential is starting to bear fruit. The 2D graph clearly shows an energy minimum (with a curiously asymmetric shape) where I suspect you will see the trapped atoms. I think you can probably limit this problem to 2D (i.e., atoms in the plane and see how they react to a fixed profile). I spoke with Kristen about this idea in 1D, but I think you might be able to map out a phase space of trapped atoms in 2D (i.e., what locations and speeds ensure that the atoms stay trapped). I'm glad to see you caught your sign mistake. Two things that I really want y'all to think about are: (1) what is this Doppler shift term? What does it mean and how does it arise? It will be important to explain to folks this aspect. And (2) why this asymmetry in the potential? Is that effective potential that a particular atom sees? Is it more fundamental than that?
