## Feedback on Project Plan and Timeline (HW9); Score: 20/20

Parker and Kristen, this project is well-scoped and it's very clear what you intend to do. I appreciate the very detailed timeline along with assignments for each of you. I think this is achievable if you stick to your timeline and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the poster. Great work!
