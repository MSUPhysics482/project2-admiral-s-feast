## Feedback on Sample Calculations (HW11); Score: 16/20

Parker and Kristen, it looks like you made some progress in modeling the potential that you care about for your analysis. There's still some gaps in your explanation of that model and how it relates to the physics (i.e., how it models what the trap does and so forth). I also am wondering where you are going next, I'm assuming that you are going to try to put a charged particle of some sort in the potential and see what it does. From the graphs it looks to me that you have a bit of a problem in that there's a signficant potential well that the partivle can drop into. Is that what you intend? As you work next week, think about what the next steps are and make sure that your final project includes a detailed explanation of the model and how it connects to the physical apparatus.
