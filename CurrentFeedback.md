## Feedback on Model (HW10); Score: 16/20

Parker and Kristen, I'm glad to see you have found a good model for the work you intend to do. I think you will both need to do some more reading on how the model is derived to be able to speak about it in more detail. I'm looking not only for the defnition of the different variables, but how the realte to the physics and what they control. Also, I'm still curious how you will bring computation into your project. It appears that you are both keeping up with the work, so that's good. Keep up the good work.
