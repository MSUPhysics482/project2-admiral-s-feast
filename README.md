# Pair Project

The second project can (but doesnâ€™t have to) build on the first project you completed alone. It is a team project that you will complete with a partner. It is meant to mimic the common practice of poster preparation and presentation. In a nutshell, you will conduct an original modeling project where you analytically and computationally model some E&M phenomenon of your choosing, prepare a poster of the project, and present it to your classmates and me.

## Questions to Answer in this Project

In working on this project, you will be trying to answer the following questions:

* What is the area of E&M that you are doing research on?
* What are the questions that you are trying to answer about this area?
* What theoretical models can be used to answer those questions?
* What analytical and computational work did you do to answer those questions?
* What were the resulting predictions that your work produced?
* What are the limitations of what you have done? What are some remaining open questions?
* What did each member of your pair contribute?

There will be six homework questions (10 if you count the 4 self-reflection homework questions) to help your team develop your poster project.

## Organizing repositories

For this project, we will use one repository for each team. We will communicate back and forth using these repositories. The repository has this file and 4 others:

1. CurrentAssignment.md is the file that describes what you are meant to turn in this week for the project.
2. OldAssignments.md is the file that describes all the assignments that you hvea completed up to the most current.
3. CurrentFeedback.md is the file that gives you the feedback on the most recent assignment you have completed.
4. OldFeedback.md is the file that gives you the feedback on all the assignments that you have completed thus far.

Besides these 5 files, you team will organize your repository as you see fit regarding writeups, notebooks, etc. But this repository like a scientific one should contain all the details of your work and all its history. That ensures you documented your work all along the way and are clearly providing an open presentation of your reproducible work.
