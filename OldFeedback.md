## Feedback on Model (HW10); Score: 16/20

Parker and Kristen, I'm glad to see you have found a good model for the work you intend to do. I think you will both need to do some more reading on how the model is derived to be able to speak about it in more detail. I'm looking not only for the defnition of the different variables, but how the realte to the physics and what they control. Also, I'm still curious how you will bring computation into your project. It appears that you are both keeping up with the work, so that's good. Keep up the good work.

## Feedback on Project Plan and Timeline (HW9); Score: 20/20

Parker and Kristen, this project is well-scoped and it's very clear what you intend to do. I appreciate the very detailed timeline along with assignments for each of you. I think this is achievable if you stick to your timeline and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the poster. Great work!

## Feedback on Initial Proposal (HW8); Score: 8/20

Parker and Kristen, I think that the idea of your project is fine, but I really don't have enough detail to judge whether the scope is right or if you are proposing something that is too narrow or too expansive. I just want to reiterate that you can select just one aspect to work on as long as it's rich enough to explore in a few different ways, but it's also ok to look a few aspects, but not in a ton of depth for each. So, for next week, I'm hoping to see quite a bit more detail in your plans.
