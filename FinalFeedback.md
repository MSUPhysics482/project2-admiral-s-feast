## HW12; Score: 20/20

Parker and Kristen, first off, I used one of your plots in talk to alumni/donors as an example of what students can do with computation in an undergadaute course. I attributed the work to you both and people were very impressed with it. Great job so far! Ok, to your question, you are right to think about how hard it is to represent multi-dimensional phase space in a plot. What can be done is that to solve the problem for a fixed choice of the other 2 (or 4) parameters. For example, map the phase space for a given variation in x and vx with other parameters fixed. You can also explore which parameters the system sensitive to and map it for those. You could also seek a relationship between the parameters and solve it for a reduced dimensional space (e.g., if it makes sense to choice a circular boundary for position, then you would know x given y). Any of these are reasonable as long as you state what you are doing and why.
